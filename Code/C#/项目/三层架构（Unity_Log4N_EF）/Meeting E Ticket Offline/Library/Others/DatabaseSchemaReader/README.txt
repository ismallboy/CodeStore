===Background===

From MSDN http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kcax58fh.aspx
+Obtaining schema information from a database is accomplished with the process of schema discovery. Schema discovery allows applications to request that managed providers find and return information about the database schema, also known as metadata, of a given database. Different database schema elements such as tables, columns, and stored-procedures are exposed through schema collections. Each schema collection contains a variety of schema information specific to the provider being used.

Each of the .NET Framework managed providers implement the GetSchema method in the Connection class, and the schema information that is returned from the GetSchema method comes in the form of a DataTable. The GetSchema method is an overloaded method that provides optional parameters for specifying the schema collection to return, and restricting the amount of information returned.+

Unfortunately the information is returned in datatables, and the schema collections are different for each provider (SqlServer, Oracle, MySql, etc).

This is an adapter which loads those collections into simple collections of plain old CLR objects, which are the same for all providers. It doesn't try to hide the underlying differences: Oracle will have packages and none of the others will. But the many small differences between tables, columns and stored procedure parameters disappear.

Because almost all ADO providers support the GetSchema standard, it can get basic schema metadata for almost all databases. Where the provider schema doesn't provide enough information, there are additional calls for specific databases (often information on primary key and foreign key columns is limited so we call the database metadata directly). We look for additional information in SqlServer, Oracle, SqlServer Ce, MySQL, Postgresql, DB2, Ingres and Sybase ASE/ASA/UltraLite.

There is are two very simple Winforms UI projects showing example uses. See the tests show how to use the class library.

It is not optimized or particularly well designed code. It was originally written in 2005, just after .Net 2.0 came out. It has been updated to .net 3.5 (although you can see the .net 2 vintage of much of it), and the project files are VS 2008 and VS 2010.

Over the years I've used it for code generation of data access code, and for conversions between database platforms. Some of this code is included, but this is not specialized for data access code gen (you could still use this library to get the schema data and then use that within T4 templating, for instance).

===Use===

To use it simply specify the connection string and ADO provider (eg System.Data,SqlClient or System.Data.OracleClient)

const string providername = "System.Data.SqlClient";
const string connectionString = @"Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Integrated Security=true;Initial Catalog=Northwind";

Create the database reader object.

var dbReader = new DatabaseReader(connectionString, providername);

For Oracle, you should always specify the Owner (Schema) as the full schema of an Oracle database is huge and will be very slow to load.
dbReader.Owner = "HR";

Then load the schema (this will take a little time on moderate to large database structures)
var schema = dbReader.ReadAll();

The DatabaseSchema object has a collection of tables, views, stored procedures, functions, packages and datatypes. Tables and views have columns, with their datatypes.

Unlike the GetSchema method, there are no datatables, and the structure is identical for all providers.

foreach (var table in schema.Tables)
{
      Debug.WriteLine("Table " + table.Name);

      foreach (var column in table.Columns)
      {
            Debug.WriteLine("\tColumn " + column.Name + "\t" + column.DataType.TypeName);
      }
}

It automatically calls DatabaseSchemaFixer to link up all the foreign key tables so you can do this:

if (column.IsForeignKey) Debug.Write("\tForeign key to " + column.ForeignKeyTable.Name);

Instead of loading the entire schema, you can load just tables, or a single table:

var table = dbReader.Table("Products");

Obviously the relations between the table cannot be created if you only load a single table, But even then it reads the constraints as well so you have a lot of information to play with.

===Stored Procedure Result Sets===

You can read the result sets for stored procedures. 
var sprocRunner = new DatabaseSchemaReader.Procedures.ResultSetReader(databaseSchema);
sprocRunner.Execute();

This uses the DbDataAdaptor.FillSchema method. Under the covers, this actually executes the stored procedure; it's within a transaction that is rolled back, so it should be safe. 

It may fail if the input parameters don't fit your logic (string parameters are set to "a", numeric ones to "0", datetime to today's date, and any other type will probably error).

The stored procedure gains a collection of DatabaseResultSets, each of which contains DatabaseColumns.


===SQL Generation===

There are also rudimentary tools to generate SQL (this is LIMITED and designed for simple databases only):

var sqlWriter = new SqlWriter(table, DatabaseSchemaReader.DataSchema.SqlType.SqlServer);
var sql = sqlWriter.SelectPageSql(); //paging sql

And you can even generate CRUD stored procedures:

var gen = new DatabaseSchemaReader.SqlGen.SqlServer.ProcedureGenerator(table);
gen.ManualPrefix = table.Name + "__";
var path = Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, "sqlserver_sprocs.sql");
gen.WriteToScript(path);

The SQL generation/ conversion utilities are very basic; at best they are a starting point for what you can do with the DatabaseSchemaReader. 

===Code generation===

The code generation is also rudimentary. Here's code gen from a SqlExpress Northwind:
//first the standard schema reader
const string providername = "System.Data.SqlClient";
const string connectionString = @"Data Source=.\SQLEXPRESS;Integrated Security=true;Initial Catalog=Northwind";
var reader = new DatabaseReader(connectionString, providername);
//if this is Oracle, set dbReader.Owner = "MyOwner";
var schema = dbReader.ReadAll();

//now write the code
var directory = new DirectoryInfo(Environment.CurrentDirectory);
var codeWriter = new CodeWriter();
codeWriter.Execute(schema, directory, "Northwind.Domain");

It writes a C# class for each table, with each column as an automatic property. Relations between classes reflect the foreign key constraints. Composite keys are handled by creating key classes. Overrides for ToString, Equals and GetHashCode are added (the last two are required for NHibernate). The properties are decorated with DataAnnotations validation attributes (there's even commented out .Net 4/SL 3 attributes). 

It also writes an NHibernate mapping class in a "mapping" subdirectory. The mapping is simple, and you probably will want to change this. It's just to get you started. If you don't need NHibernate, simply ignore this.

For each stored procedure, it writes a class to create the DbCommand with all the parameters exposed as simple .net parameters. It also creates a method (Execute) to execute the stored procedure. If you have the result sets (you used ResultSetReader) the Execute method will return classes typed to the result sets and your output parameters, so the only ADO you need is to create the DbConnection. It only understands simple parameter types (numbers, string, dates) plus Oracle ref cursors; lobs and specialized data types are beyond the scope.

If you use Oracle packages, the generated code is grouped with a folder/namespace that matches the package name.

If a stored procedure has ResultSets (if you used ResultSetReader), a typed result class is generated, and the stored procedure class has an Execute method.

It also writes VS2008 and VS2010 csproj files, with the same name as the namespace. The mapping files are correctly included as embedded resources. In practice, you'll probably include the class files in your own project.

===Comparisons===

You can compare the schemas of two databases to get a diff script. 
//load your schemas
var schema1 = new DatabaseReader(connectionString, providername).ReadAll();
var schema2 = new DatabaseReader(connectionString2, providername).ReadAll();

//compare
var comparison = new CompareSchemas(schema1, schema2);
var script = comparison.Execute();

The script will include the migrations needed to transform schema1 into schema2.
The migrations will include create/drop/alter tables, columns, constraints and indexes.
It also supports views and stored procedures.

The migrations are simple. Complicated migrations are not supported (for example changing a column datatype which would require an explicit cast). The order of the migrations may not be correct (if one change depends on another change made later in the generated script).

For more advanced use, SqlCompare and other commercial tools are recommended.

===UIs===

There are two simple UIs.

* DatabaseSchemaViewer. It reads all the schema and displays it in a treeview. It also includes options for 
 - code generation, table DDL and stored procedure generation.
 - comparing the schema to another database.

* CopyToSQLite. It reads all the schema and creates a new SQLite database file with the same tables and data. If Sql Server CE 4.0 is detected, it can do the same for that database. These databases do not have the full range of data types as other databases, so creating tables may fail (e.g. SqlServer CE 4 does not have VARCHAR(MAX)). In addition, copying data may violate foreign key constraints (especially for identity primary keys) and will fail.
